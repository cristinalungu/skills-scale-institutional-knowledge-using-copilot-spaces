# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Business Analyst elicits and documents detailed requirements
3. UX Designer conducts user research and creates initial wireframes
4. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
5. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
6. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
7. Identify dependencies and integration points
8. QA Lead develops initial test strategy and approach
9. Technical Writer outlines documentation requirements
10. Create release plan and milestone map

## Phase Handoffs
- **Requirements → Design**: Business Analyst delivers requirements document → UX Designer begins design work
- **Design → Development**: UX Designer delivers approved designs → Developers begin implementation planning
- **Planning → Execution**: Project Manager delivers sprint plan → Scrum Master facilitates sprint kickoff

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
